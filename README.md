# course-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-the-complete-guide
This repository aims to store all code developed during a period of specialized studies in Artificial Intelligence. In this study we will approach issues such as: Search and Optimization Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, etc.

In the study, we learn to:

* The theoretical and practical basis of the main Artificial Intelligence algorithms
* Implementing Artificial Intelligence algorithms from scratch and using libraries
* Learn in theory and practice about Machine Learning algorithms for classification, regression, association and grouping rules
* Learning Machine Learning without even knowing a line of programming
* Use the Orange visual tool to create, analyze and test algorithms
* Using the Python programming language to create Artificial Intelligence algorithms
* Learn the Basics of Python Programming
* Use the greedy search algorithms and A* (A Star) to find the shortest route between cities
* Implement optimization algorithms for minimization and maximization problems
* Implement an AI to predict the amount of tip to be given in a restaurant, using fuzzy logic
* Use data exploration techniques applied to a COVID-19 disease database
* Create an agent with reinforcement learning to control taxi passengers
* Use artificial neural networks and recurrent neural networks to classify images of the characters Homer and Bart, from the Simpsons cartoon
* Learn Natural Language Processing Techniques and Create a Feeling Classifier
* Detect and recognize faces using computer vision techniques
* Track video objects using computer vision
* Create multi-agent systems to simulate communication between agents
